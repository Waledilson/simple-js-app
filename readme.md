Pokedex app

About
This app uses the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript including jQuery throughout to showcase the different tools and ideas i've learned during this achievement.
The idea behind it is simple. Pokemon characters are displayed from an external API and listed using buttons where you can click on each one and a modal will show the selected Pokemon's name, height and picture.

Dependencies
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Pokemon API, Javascript, jQuery
